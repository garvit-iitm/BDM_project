## 🏢 Organization Background

Bhatnagar Digital Library is a student-focused study center in Bareilly offering quiet, distraction-free spaces for learners. Launched in 2024 by Abhai Singh Bhatnagar and Lakshya Singh Bhatnagar, it features private cabins, Wi-Fi, group rooms, and full-day access for competitive exam aspirants.

Despite its potential, the library faces challenges like low visibility, underutilized services, and no structured data for growth decisions. This project addresses these issues using business data management techniques.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a data-driven modernization strategy that improves student footfall, optimizes space usage, and enables growth through better marketing, record-keeping, and pricing decisions.

1. **Low Student Footfall** – Lack of awareness and weak promotional outreach
